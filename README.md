A basic soduku-generator which demonstrates the use of genetic algorithms.
No math algorithms are used here, ONLY the genetic algorithm technique.
This shows the power of the technique as you need ZERO knowledge of the math behind soduko.
I made it from scratch, and now I know that I know how to make a basic genetic algorithm :)
